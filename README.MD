# Pac Man Factory
In this project, I made a program that generates pacman figure (bouncy ball in my case) that moves in random direction at random velocity. I was able to create randomness using math.random function. You can also increase the velocity by clicking the increase velocity button on top left.

## How to run
To run this project, you simply have to click on the create add bouncy ball button as many as you want. You can also increase the velocity of the balls by clicking the ass velocity button.

## Things to add in future
I'd like to add a function that can create each ball unique. For example, users can click on the ball they want to edit.
